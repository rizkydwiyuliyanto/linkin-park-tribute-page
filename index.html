Bennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was a worldwide commercial success. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the best-selling debut album of the decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to achieve that many sales.Linkin Park's following studio albums, from Meteora (2003) to One More Light (2017), continued the band's success.

        <p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 1.6;margin-bottom: 1.5em;">It's not the saddest part of today, but it's still absolutely heartbreaking that Chester Bennington didn't live to see rock's history writers come around on Linkin Park. It would have happened -- absolutely would've, eventually. The band was too big, too influential, too talented, too smart, too innovative. Sure, they had the misfortune of their commercial and artistic apex coming at a peak for mainstream rock music at its most blunt and least imaginative, and the double misfortune of being directly influential on a lot of the bands responsible for making it so.

But that was never Linkin Park themselves. Their best music was electric, boundary-pushing and undeniably vital. Dismissing them along with the thudding misogyny that marked nu-metal deep into the '00s is no fairer than writing off Nirvana with the middling bands of '90s post-grunge. As I wrote when discussing Hybrid Theory in a ranked list of Diamond-selling albums -- and yeah, don't forget just how huge that album was, arguably bigger than any other rock album this century -- "For all the skeptics who view Linkin Park as a bunch of whiny, repetitive, dull, uncreative mooks: No, you’re thinking of every other popular band from that time."</p>
